DJANGO-RESTFUL
==============

WORK IN PROGRESS

A set of class-based views, mixins and utilities, which will transparently
manage serialization, deserialization and other aspects of RESTful resources
based off a Django site's models.

The views are based off Django 1.3 Class-Based-Views, so Django 1.3 is needed
or a backport of the relevant classes.
